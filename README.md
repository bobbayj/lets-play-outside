I am really rusty with Vue and front-end dev but will do my best.

        - Indoors
        - Outdoors
        - Don't care
    - Q2: What do you want to do?
        - Eat
        - Shop
        - Explore
    - Q3: Where do you want to go?
        - Close (<10km, 20min drive)
        - Far (20min to 1hr drive)
        - Road trip (1hr drive)
        - Anywhere
- Have filters to generate the next item once they start generating locations
    - Filter 1: What is your budget?
        - Feeling bougie
        - Money's tight
        - Whatever
    - Filter 2: Change what you want to do?
        - Eat
        - Shop
        - Explore
- Swipe left / right?
- Once they select, open navigation?
